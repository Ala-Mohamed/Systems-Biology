# Systems-Biology
n this project, we simulate the concepts presented in the paper titled "De Novo Design of Protein Logic Gates." We develop a system of differential equations to model the behavior of protein-based logic gates. Using SciPy and Matplotlib, we solve these equations and visualize the outcomes for various scenarios.
